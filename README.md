# Social-Network-API

  ## Description

  This project is a backend application for a social network web service that allows users to share thoughts, react to friends' posts, and build a friend list using a RESTful API. It's built with Node.js and Express for server-side logic, with MongoDB as the database for storing and managing unstructured data efficiently.

  ## Usage
